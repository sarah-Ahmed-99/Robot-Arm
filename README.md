#### The arm is designed with 5 primary rotational axes or joints, which grants it a high degree of flexibility and mobility. This allows the arm to reach a wide range of positions and orientations, enabling it to accomplish a diverse set of tasks and movements.

#### The 5 degrees of freedom provide the arm with a comprehensive range of motion, empowering it to maneuver and position itself in complex and versatile ways. This enhanced flexibility is a key feature that enhances the arm's overall capabilities and functionality.
